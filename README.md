# code-of-conduct

https://github.com/meetthepeople/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md

- is valid for all mtp repos
- must be referenced in all readmes
- people can/should/must (?) add a statement to a *SIGNEES.md* ala "...have read the CoC, will respect it and help enforcing it." if they want to contribute to the project in any way
- exception for sending PRs to add events to the list

(could be automated like google is doing with signing their contributor licenses.)
